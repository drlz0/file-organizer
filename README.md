# file organizer
## Organize your files
available options for now is changing names of all images in folder in a way that it gets incremented by 1.<br>
example:<br>
input path: path/to/folder <br>
input name: file_ <br>
input type: jpg <br>
this will go through all image files (jpg, png, bmp, jpeg) and change names sequentially into file_1.jpg, file_2.jpg, file_3.jpg and so on. <br>
works on linux and windows 10
